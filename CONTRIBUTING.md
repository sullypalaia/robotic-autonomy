# Contributing Guidelines

- For tutorial use ros2/_assets/template.md template and only deviate if necessary.
- For branching use `<topic>-<g{i}>` naming convention.
- Images, Gifs, and other media should be stored in _assets files, the code can be stored in the same directory as the tutorial.
- Use Git-LFS for media files larger than 1MB.
